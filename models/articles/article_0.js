When working full stack to produce a dynamic website, it's really nice to be able to think in one language and not have to switch context when switching between front and back. Having said that I've developed a rather love-hate relationship with JavaScript.</span>",

    content: "<span>Another major factor in choosing the framework is the impressive amount of cross-platform support by some big players over the past few years. Because I'm a huge fan of both Linux and Windows, it's also huge that Node.js and the tools I love for development have been well integrated into both operating systems. I've been very impressed and happy with Microsoft's recent push to better integrate with Linux. The introduction of Windows Subsytem Linux (WSL) and being able to launch a terminal in a Windows boot has, frankly, improved my quality of life. It's still somewhat limited in its infancy, but moving through Windows in the Ubuntu terminal and having a good deal of my bash scripts largely functional on Windows is wonderful. Command propmt and powershell can be great tools, and I've written some handy .bat files over the years, but I've never found myself craving them the way I do a Linux terminal.</span>",

    content: "<span>Another boon is Microsoft's Visual Studio (VS) Code. Having used Visual Studio IDE professionally for various projects (we're currently using it for tool development at Digital Flight), Node.js gave me the perfect excuse to try out the open-sourced editor with the same brand. Despite the branding, VS Code is built atop Electron, a great project released by GitHub. Electron is a framework used to make Node.js applications compile for the desktop which means the editor literally has Node.js at its heart and it's pumping JavaScript for blood. The VS Code source is a great example of a well built and sophisticated Node.js application, you can check it out <a id='outsideLink' href='https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode'>here</a>. It stands to reason that VS Code would excel at supporting the framework it was written it and, based on my experience so far, I can very much confirm this. VS Code extends the quality I've come to appreciate from the Visual Studio IDE and really streamlines the development process. It's debugger is first rate (in today's update, they've added the ability to set breakpoints on specific columns, perfect for JavaScript's Russian doll-like style). Add to the mix a vibrant and active open source community and it's gold.</span>",

I like the optimistic analysis Alexander Morgaut gives <a id='outsideLink' href='https://www.quora.com/Is-Node-js-declining-already'>here</a> on Quora in response to a user's question about Node.js potentially declining.</span>",

One point he doesn't make, but is worth adding is the recent release of Angular 2.0. The release of the front-end framework has largely been entwined with TypeScript and the Node.js ecosystem. Once the framework really takes off, and I believe it is destined to do so, Node.js is going to be central in spinning up and serving client side functionality. If this sort of momentum sustains, Node.js is only going to become more popular.</span>",
